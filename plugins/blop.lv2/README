BLOP.LV2
========

This is a port of the BLOP LADSPA plugins by Mike Rawes to LV2.

This is a mostly faithful port of blop-0.2.8, except plugin variants have been
eliminated via the use of morphable Control/CV ports.  This way, users do not
have to choose from several versions of the same plugin, but the host can
configure controls to be control-rate or audio-rate as appropriate.  This
mechanism is backwards compatible, so these ports will simply appear as normal
LV2 control ports in hosts that do not support port morphing.
