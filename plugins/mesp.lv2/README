Mesp
====

Mesp (for Message Processing) is a set of LV2 plugins that process events.

These plugins are for working with LV2 Atom messages, particularly "objects".
An object or "resource" can be thought of as a set of properties, or a
dictionary with URI keys.  Using these plugins, objects can be constructed,
destructed, filtered, and analyzed, which allows for higher level programming
using LV2 plugins as primitives.  These plugins are primarily useful in a
modular environment such as Ingen.
