Machina
=======

Machina is a MIDI sequencer based on Finite State Automata.

A machine can be constructed manually from the user interface, recorded from
MIDI input (free-form or step), or loaded from a MIDI file.  The probability of
arcs can be manipulated to build a machine that produces structured but
constantly changing output.  This way, Machina can be used as a generative
recording tool that plays back patterns similar to, but not identical to, the
original input.
